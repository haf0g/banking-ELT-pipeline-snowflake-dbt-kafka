## 📌 Project Overview

This project demonstrates an **end-to-end modern data stack pipeline** for the **banking domain**, implementing **Medallion Architecture** with **real-time streaming CDC**. The objective is to capture transaction flows and customer profile changes in real-time, historize them using **SCD Type 2** mechanisms, and deliver reliable strategic dashboards.

The solution relies on a robust **ELT** (Extract, Load, Transform) architecture, orchestrated by **Airflow** and transformed by **dbt** within **Snowflake**, following **best practices of CI/CD and data warehousing**.

👉 Think of it as a **production-grade banking data ecosystem** built on modern data tools.

### Pipeline Flow

1. **Data Generation** → Simulates banking data (customers, accounts, transactions) using Python (Faker) into PostgreSQL
2. **Streaming & CDC** → Debezium captures changes (WAL) from Postgres and publishes them to Kafka
3. **Landing Zone** → A Python consumer stores Kafka messages as Parquet files in MinIO (S3-compatible storage)
4. **Orchestration** → Airflow manages the transfer from MinIO to Snowflake and triggers dbt transformations
5. **Data Warehouse** → Snowflake hosts data across Bronze, Silver, and Gold layers
6. **Transformation** → dbt cleans, deduplicates, and historizes data
7. **Visualization** → Power BI & Tableau consume final data marts

## ⚙️ Technical Implementation Phases

### **Phase 1: Semi-Structured Data Ingestion (Bronze Layer)**

Data arrives from Kafka in raw JSON format. To ensure pipeline resilience against schema evolution, we use Snowflake's **VARIANT** type.

- **Mechanism**: Loading via PUT and COPY INTO orchestrated by Airflow
- **RAW Schema**: Storing complete JSON objects to enable full reprocessing if needed
- **Technology**: Snowflake VARIANT, Apache Airflow, MinIO

**Challenge solved**: Schema flexibility for evolving data structures without breaking the pipeline.

---

### **Phase 2: Orchestration with Apache Airflow**

The entire pipeline is automated through two main DAGs:

- **minio_to_snowflake_banking**: Manages physical file transfer and initial ingestion
- **SCD2_snapshots**: Handles intelligent processing (dbt snapshot, run, test)

**Security**: Using SnowflakeHook for centralized connection management.

**DAG Features**:
- Error handling and retry logic
- Task dependencies and parallelization
- Monitoring and alerting capabilities

---

### **Phase 3: Analytics Engineering with dbt**

The transformation from raw to analytics-ready format follows three stages:

#### **Staging Models**
- JSON field extraction and data typing
- Deduplication using `ROW_NUMBER()` window functions
- Data cleaning and standardization

#### **Snapshots (SCD Type 2)**
- Complete traceability of account and customer modifications
- Tracking changes in email, name, balance, and account status
- Valid_from and valid_to timestamps for temporal queries

#### **Feature Engineering**
- Calculation of **Customer Loyalty Class** (Platinum, Gold, Silver) based on customer tenure (months_active)
- Aggregated transaction metrics per customer
- Account activity indicators

**Models Architecture**:
```
staging/
├── stg_customers
├── stg_accounts
└── stg_transactions

marts/
├── dim_customers (with loyalty segmentation)
├── dim_accounts
├── dim_date
└── fact_transactions
```

---

### **Phase 4: Data Quality & Integrity**

Implementation of **14 automated tests** to validate banking data reliability:

| Test Category | Tests Implemented |
|--------------|-------------------|
| **Uniqueness** | Primary keys on all dimensions and facts |
| **Not Null** | Critical fields (customer_id, account_id, transaction_id) |
| **Referential Integrity** | Relationships between Facts and Dimensions |
| **Accepted Values** | Transaction statuses (COMPLETED, FAILED, PENDING) |
| **Custom Tests** | Balance consistency, date logic validation |

**Testing Framework**: dbt native tests + custom schema tests

---

### **Phase 5: BI Modeling (Star Schema)**

The Power BI dashboard is built on a **pure star schema** to optimize performance and query simplicity:

#### **Fact Table**
- **FACT_TRANSACTIONS**: Contains transaction amounts, dates, IDs, and foreign keys
- Grain: One row per transaction
- Measures: Total amount, transaction count, success rate

#### **Dimension Tables**
- **DIM_CUSTOMERS**: Customer attributes with loyalty segmentation
- **DIM_ACCOUNTS**: Account details, types, and statuses
- **DIM_DATE**: Calendar dimension for time intelligence

**Challenges Resolved**:
- Fixed ambiguous filter path relationships by denormalizing customer_id into the fact table
- Synchronized temporal granularity (Date vs DateTime) between Snowflake and Power BI
- Created calculated column `Date_Link` to connect timestamps with calendar dimension

---

## 🛠️ Technical Challenges & Solutions

| Challenge | Problem | Solution |
|-----------|---------|----------|
| **Filter Ambiguity** | Multiple relationship paths between Date and Transactions causing incorrect filtering | Denormalized customer_id into fact table to simplify Star Schema relationships |
| **VARIANT Handling** | Raw JSON data difficult to query and analyze | Used dbt SQL transformations to flatten JSON into structured columns |
| **Temporal Filters** | DateTime mismatch between Snowflake timestamps and Power BI Date dimension | Created calculated column to extract date from timestamp for proper joins |
| **Data Deduplication** | CDC events can create duplicate records | Implemented `ROW_NUMBER()` partitioning in staging models |
| **Historical Tracking** | Need to track changes over time without losing history | Implemented SCD Type 2 using dbt snapshots with valid_from/valid_to |

### **Accessing the Data**

```sql
-- Query Snowflake to verify data
USE DATABASE BANKING;
USE SCHEMA MARTS;

-- Check customer loyalty distribution
SELECT loyalty_class, COUNT(*) as customer_count
FROM dim_customers
GROUP BY loyalty_class;

-- Check transaction success rate
SELECT 
    transaction_status,
    COUNT(*) as transaction_count,
    ROUND(COUNT(*) * 100.0 / SUM(COUNT(*)) OVER(), 2) as percentage
FROM fact_transactions
GROUP BY transaction_status;
